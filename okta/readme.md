# OpenShift + Okta OAuth Integration Guide

## Overview

In order to integrate OpenShift with Okta using OAuth authentication, follow the steps outlined in this repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure you have an application created on Okta.
2. OpenShift 4 SNO/CRC/Cluster should be running.
3. OpenShift should be able to reach Okta.

## Steps

1. If you do not have an Okta account and application, first create a trial account at [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/)
2. Create an application integration by navigating to:
   ```
   Applications >> Create App Integration
   ```

5. Specify the **Redirect URL** of OpenShift. It should look like the following. Note that `okta` at the end of the URL is the authentication source name that you'll configure in OpenShift.
   ```bash
   https://oauth-openshift.apps.url/oauth2callback/<idp-provider-name>
   ```

7. Copy the **OKTA URL** from your browser's URL bar. It should look like:
   ```
   https://dev-12345678-admin.okta.com/
   ```
8. Create a user by going to:
   ```
   Directory >> People >> Add Person
   ```

9. Provide a username and email ID. Choose **Password** as `set by admin`, set the password, and save.

12. At the bottom of the page, click:
    ```
    Add >> OpenID Connect
    ```

13. Enter the following details that were copied from the Okta console and submit. Also, use the same authentication source name `okta` as provided in Step 5.
    ```bash
    Client ID
    Client Secret
    Issuer URL
    ```
    ![Fill Details](images/9-fill-oauth-details.png)
14. Wait a few minutes for the OAuth pods to restart.
15. Try logging on OCP console. When you try to reach the Console URL choose okta.
